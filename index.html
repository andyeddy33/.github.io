    <h1>The New Home of the Atlanta Braves: SunTrust Park</h1>
    <h3>Coded by: Andrew Edwards on 04/18/17 </h3>
   
    </div>
    <p>SunTrust Park is the third ballpark the Braves have played in while they've been in Atlanta since 1966. Atlanta Fulton County Stadium was the home of the Braves from 1966 until 1996. Then, Turner Field was erected in 1996 for the Atlanta Olympics Games, and the Braves called this stadium their home from 1997 until 2016. Finally, we have the third rendition of Atlanta Braves baseball coming to SunTrust Park this year in 2017. They say the third time is the charm, so let's hope this ballpark brings our team some luck. Below is an image of the recently finished SunTrust Park in Northwest Atlanta. </p>

        <p>
    As you can see above, SunTrust Park looks a good bit like the former stadium, Turner Field, but there are several differences between the two ballparks. Below is a table comparing Turner Field and SunTrust Park.
